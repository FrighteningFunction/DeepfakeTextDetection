# Important notes

Reqs for env are in 'Requirements.txt'. You need __pyton 3.9__ in order for this to work. You will need to install another torch subpackage when prompted. So far this is the best solution. Don't forget, or you will spend a lot of time prepping the env.

For Windows, 'my_eval.ps1' has to be used!
