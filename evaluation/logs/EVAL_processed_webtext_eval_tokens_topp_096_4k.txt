But even roses, in their perfect prime,
Must fade and wither, lose their vibrant hue,
And fall to earth, consumed by cruelest time,
A fleeting beauty, ever fresh and new.
    Yet in their death, a seed of hope remains,
    To bloom anew, and break the chains of pains.

Thy lips, like roses, offer sweet delight,
A taste of heaven, eternally.
Thy hair, a silken stream, a flowing tide,
Doth cascade down, a captivating sight,
And in thy grace, my spirit doth abide,
Enchanted by thy presence, pure and light.
    So let me gaze upon thy lovely face,
    And find in thee, my solace and my grace.

Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun
And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud
All men make faults and even I in this
Authorizing thy trespass with compare
Myself corrupting salving thy amiss
Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are
For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense
Thy adverse party is thy advocate
And gainst myself a lawful plea commence
Such civil war is in my love and hate
    That I an accessary needs must be
    To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me

Against this coming end you should prepare
And your sweet semblance to some other give
So should that beauty which you hold in lease
Find no determination then you were
Yourself again after yourselfs decease
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay
Which husbandry in honour might uphold
Against the stormy gusts of winters day
And barren rage of deaths eternal cold
    O none but unthrifts Dear my love you know
    You had a father let your son say so

Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars
Unlookd for joy in that I honour most
Great princes favourites their fair leaves spread
But as the marigold at the suns eye
And in themselves their pride lies buried
For at a frown they in their glory die
The painful warrior famoused for fight
After a thousand victories once foild
Is from the book of honour razed quite
And all the rest forgot for which he toild
    Then happy I that love and am beloved
    Where I may not remove nor be removed

Processing article: When icicles hang heavy on the eaves,
And frosty breath doth paint the window pane,
My heart doth yearn for warmth, and gentle leaves,
And sunbeams dancing on the verdant plain.
But winter's grip holds fast, a chilling hand,
That binds the earth in slumber, stark and deep,
And though I strive, I cannot understand
Why nature's beauty thus should fall asleep.
Yet in this stillness, a quiet peace I find,
A solace born of solitude and snow,
A patient waiting for the spring's design,
To watch the frozen streams begin to flow.
   So let the cold wind blow, the snow descend,
   For hope remains, until the bitter end.

Processing article: When Icicles hang by the wall so high,
And bitter winds do pierce the frozen ground,
My heart doth yearn for summer's gentle sigh,
And warmth that in the sun's bright rays is found.
The robin's song, a memory so sweet,
Doth whisper tales of blossoms newly sprung,
While winter's grip doth bind my weary feet,
And silence reigns where melodies were sung.
Oh, cruelest season, when the world lies still,
And hope's frail flame flickers and threatens low,
My spirit aches, consumed by winter's chill,
And longs for verdant fields where soft winds blow.
   Yet even now, a promise I can see,
   That spring's return will set my spirit free.

To let base clouds oertake me in my way
Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke
Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break
To dry the rain on my stormbeaten face
For no man well of such a salve can speak
That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace
Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief
Though thou repent yet I have still the loss
The offenders sorrow lends but weak relief
To him that bears the strong offences cross
    Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds
    And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds

And frosty breath doth paint the window pane,
Then doth my love, with beauty in her eye,
Appear more fair than summer's gentle reign.
Her cheeks, like roses kissed by winter's frost,
Do blush with hues of crimson, white, and red,
And in her gaze, a warmth that's never lost,
Doth chase away the shadows in my head.
Her voice, a chime of bells on snowy hills,
Doth melt the ice that binds my frozen heart,
And in her smile, a joy my spirit fills,
A solace from the world's relentless dart.
    So let the winds blow fierce, the snow descend,
    My love's warm light shall ever know no end.

What can mine own praise to mine own self bring
And what is t but mine own when I praise thee
Even for this let us divided live
And our dear love lose name of single one
That by this separation I may give
That due to thee which thou deservest alone
O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove
Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave
To entertain the time with thoughts of love
Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive
    And that thou teachest how to make one twain
    By praising him here who doth hence remain

Why with the time do I not glance aside
To newfound methods and to compounds strange
Why write I still all one ever the same
And keep invention in a noted weed
That every word doth almost tell my name
Showing their birth and where they did proceed
O know sweet love I always write of you
And you and love are still my argument
So all my best is dressing old words new
Spending again what is already spent
    For as the sun is daily new and old
    So is my love still telling what is told

The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing
My bonds in thee are all determinate
For how do I hold thee but by thy granting
And for that riches where is my deserving
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting
And so my patent back again is swerving
Thyself thou gavest thy own worth then not knowing
Or me to whom thou gavest it else mistaking
So thy great gift upon misprision growing
Comes home again on better judgment making
    Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter
    In sleep a king but waking no such matter

And winter's breath doth chill the frosted ground,
My heart, a captive held by frozen grieves,
Doth yearn for spring, where warmer days are found.
The sun, a pallid ghost behind the clouds,
Doth cast a shadow long and bleak and drear,
While memory, like mist in valleys shrouds,
The joys of summer, vanished from this sphere.
But hope, a fragile flower, dares to bloom,
Despite the biting wind and falling snow,
And whispers of a brighter time to come,
A promise whispered soft, a gentle glow.
   So let the winter's reign its course pursue,
   For spring's sweet dawn will surely break anew.
